# moq-video

Native video capture, encoding, decoding, and publishing for
[Media over QUIC](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq).

The video counterpart to [`moq-audio`](https://crates.io/crates/moq-audio).
Everything is native per-platform code with no ffmpeg dependency: capture, color
conversion, and the codec backends are all in-tree or thin wrappers over system
frameworks / vendored static libs. The public API is codec-agnostic, so no
signature, type, or error variant names a backend or a capture implementation;
swapping or bumping a backend crate is not a breaking change.

## Capture

The opt-in `capture` feature exposes the device APIs and their per-platform
backends. Enable it with `cargo add moq-video --features capture`; the default
codec-only build accepts frames supplied by the caller and compiles none of the
device backends. Nothing is needed on the build host either way.

Per-platform, picked at compile time:

- **macOS**: AVFoundation (camera) and ScreenCaptureKit (display, window, or
  application), yielding zero-copy `CVPixelBuffer` surfaces straight to
  VideoToolbox.
- **Linux**: native V4L2 (camera; YUYV resampled, MJPEG via `zune-jpeg`) and
  xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire on Wayland (display; behind the `pipewire`
  feature), with native X11 monitor/window selection and capture as the X11
  fallback. The Wayland picker dialog chooses the screen, and the portal's
  restore token is reused so demand-driven reopens don't re-prompt.
- **Windows**: native Media Foundation (camera; `IMFSourceReader`) and
  Windows.Graphics.Capture (display and window; Windows 10 2004/build 19041
  or newer). Screen capture honors `Config::cursor` and converts BGRA to an
  owned NV12 texture on the GPU, shared with the Media Foundation encoder;
  software encoding downloads that texture. Odd screen edges are cropped to
  even dimensions. Builds before 19041 return `Error::Unsupported`, with no
  older capture fallback. The system capture border remains unless borderless
  access is available (build 20348+) and granted.

`capture::cameras()` lists AVFoundation, V4L2, or Media Foundation cameras with
identifiers accepted by `capture::Source::Camera`. `capture::displays()` does
the same for macOS, Windows, and X11 displays. `capture::windows()` lists macOS,
Windows, and X11 windows. Wayland display selection stays in the desktop portal
picker, which does not expose a stable display identifier.

Windows `display:N` selectors are enumeration indices, not persistent monitor
identities. Switching from Desktop Duplication to WGC can change which monitor
a saved selector names. Run `moq devices` again and reselect the intended display
after upgrading.

Embedded applications can consume raw capture without creating a MoQ
broadcast:

```rust
let mut config = moq_video::capture::Config::default();
config.source = moq_video::capture::Source::Display(None);

let mut capture = moq_video::capture::open(&config).await?;
while let Some(frame) = capture.read().await? {
    // Encode, render, or inspect the newest captured frame; `frame.surface`
    // holds the pixels and `frame.timestamp` the capture time.
}
```

The stream retains only the newest unconsumed frame, so a slow encoder adds
drops rather than latency. `read` ends with `None` when the source stopped for
a benign reason, such as a window resize, so reopen to follow it. Permission
denial and a source disappearing are terminal, reported as
`Error::PermissionDenied` and `Error::SourceUnavailable`.
On Windows, opening an already minimized window returns `Error::SourceUnavailable`.
After capture starts, receiving no usable first frame within five seconds also
returns `Error::SourceUnavailable` and releases the capture session.
An established capture pauses while the window is minimized. Unchanged Windows
content repeats the last owned GPU texture at the configured frame rate, with
advancing presentation timestamps, so a static share remains live.

On a Windows desktop, `just rs test -p moq-video --features capture --run-ignored only -E 'test(wgc_)'` runs the opt-in WGC hardware exercises.
Set `MOQ_WGC_WINDOW=window:HWND` to a visible, odd-sized window from
`moq devices` first. These tests capture each monitor and the selected window
with cursor capture on and off, reopen sessions, verify owned NV12 pixels after
pool reuse, and check SD/HD conversion and encoder color descriptions. They
require a GPU video processor and a hardware H.264 encoder; unsupported
hardware fails rather than silently skipping the exercise. Cursor appearance,
resize/close/minimize behavior, hybrid-GPU monitors, and border permissions
still need visual checks. The conversion workload prints submission time and
batch completion time including one final readback, not end-to-end latency.

## Encode

The codec is chosen via `encode::Codec`. Backends are tried in order (hardware
first, then software) and the first that opens wins; `encode::Kind` narrows the
choice (`Auto` / `Hardware` / `Software` / a named backend).

| Codec | Software | macOS | Windows | Linux | Android |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H.264 | OpenH264 (feature `openh264`, default) | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation | NVENC (feature `nvidia`), VAAPI (feature `vaapi`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| H.265 | none | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation | NVENC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |

Every backend emits Annex-B with in-band parameter sets (SPS/PPS, plus VPS for
H.265), so the matching `moq_mux::codec` importer handles framing and catalog
registration directly. There is no software H.265 encoder (it's hardware-only).

`encode::Encoder::encode` takes a raw `Frame` (a timestamp plus a `Surface`
holding the pixels) and returns `encode::Encoded`s: one whole access unit each,
carrying the timestamp of the picture it was encoded from and whether it is a
keyframe, forced by `cut()` or on the GOP cadence. The timestamp matters for a
backend that buffers, which hands back an earlier frame's access unit while a
later one goes in, and for the tail `finish()` drains. Bring your own pixels with
`Surface::rgba(...)`, or feed a frame straight from capture or `decode`.

Group boundaries are automatic: `Config::gop` says how the stream is divided
(`Gop::Keyframe { interval }` places a keyframe every so many frames, and an
interval of zero is refused at open), so an application never has to think
about them. `Encoder::cut()` opens a group at the next frame when something
outside the encoder needs a decodable starting point there: a source group
boundary, a scene change, a source switch. The request is held until a frame
arrives, so it is safe to call before you have one. It fails with
`Error::CutUnsupported` on a backend that cannot force a boundary (a V4L2
driver without the force-keyframe control), and queues nothing then: groups
keep falling where `Config::gop` puts them. `encode::Sink` answers the same
way, awaited.

Public entry points:

- `encode::publish_capture(...)` captures a webcam, encodes it, and publishes on
  demand: the track and catalog are advertised up front, but the camera opens
  only while a subscriber is watching and is released when the last one leaves.
- `encode::Control::new(...)` does the same but returns a `Control` handle with
  the `Driver` that runs it, like `moq-audio`'s. `Control::cut()` asks for a
  keyframe: requests coalesce, any keyframe serves them (the GOP cadence
  included), and a forced one lands at least 500ms after any other. On a
  backend that cannot force one it returns `Error::CutUnsupported` and the
  publish carries on. Dropping the last `Control` ends the `Driver` promptly,
  even mid-open.
- `encode::Producer` publishes frames you encoded yourself (`publish(&[Encoded])`),
  handling the catalog and framing. Each is published at its own timestamp.

The default features are `openh264`, `nvidia`, and `mediacodec`. OpenH264 keeps
a working software H.264 fallback but compiles vendored C++; disable defaults
and select native features to omit it. `nvidia` is Linux-only, `dlopen`s the
driver at runtime, and needs no build-time toolkit. `vaapi` is opt-in because
its bindgen needs libclang on the build host, while `v4l2` is opt-in only by
convention, since `moq-v4l` checks its bindings in. `vpx` is opt-in because
libvpx comes from the build host through pkg-config (set `VPX_STATIC=1` to link
the archive, as the Nix dev shell does). `render` is also opt-in so codec-only
consumers do not compile wgpu.

### External Vulkan producers

External Linux Vulkan producers construct `frame::vulkan::Slot` from exported
memory and timeline FDs, an `Image` describing the format, allocation, and
memory handle type, and a guard retaining the producer's allocation. Device
and driver UUIDs identify the exporter; opaque memory also carries its original
memory type index, while DMA-BUF memory carries its DRM modifier and explicit
plane offsets and row pitches, including producer padding.

Set `encode::Config::input` to the image's device before opening or probing the
encoder. `Kind::Auto` selects an importing backend on that device and refuses
unsupported devices without a CPU fallback. Feed each published image through
`Surface::Vulkan`; NVENC privately imports it into CUDA, shares one full-size
NV12 conversion per capture and color space, and scales each rendition on the
GPU. Pin `Config::color` when renditions cross the SD/HD color-inference boundary.

`Slot::publish` consumes the producer slot and `Completion::wait` returns it
only after the last reader finishes its GPU work. Publish only what you will
encode: an unconsumed or failed frame fails completion and loses its slot for
good, since nothing signalled its timeline, so drop excess captures before
publishing. Non-exportable application images need a GPU copy into an exportable
slot. External Vulkan images have no CPU mapping or download fallback.

External DMA-BUF producers use `DmaBuf::new` with an owned FD, `DmaBufLayout`,
and a release guard; their buffers also refuse CPU download.

Run `just rs gpu` for the opt-in native hardware exercise. It creates a
Vulkan image independently of Unreal, imports it once into CUDA, checks repeated
slot reuse and held-reader ordering, and tears down through cancellation; a
second test converts RGBA and BGRA uploads to NV12, scales them, fills the pool,
and encodes both renditions through NVENC. A third runs the target workload,
three 1280x720 views at 30 fps, and prints per-stage latency and CPU time
instead of asserting a threshold.

## Decode

`decode::Consumer` (the mirror of `moq_audio::decode::Consumer`) subscribes to an
H.264, H.265, AV1, VP8, or VP9 track and returns raw `Frame`s. A hardware-decoded frame stays
on the GPU: feeding it back to a compatible hardware `encode::Encoder` on the
same device keeps it there (the transcode path), while `into_i420()` downloads
it. An encoder that can't take that surface (openh264, or a different device)
downloads it through I420 for you. Every frame carries a `Surface`, a
`#[non_exhaustive]` enum naming where the pixels live (`PixelBuffer` on macOS and iOS,
`Texture` on Windows, `Vulkan` and `Cuda` on Linux, `HardwareBuffer` on Android,
or CPU `I420`). Match
it to take a GPU path for a representation you recognize, and fall back to
`Surface::into_i420()` for readback-capable surfaces. GPU-only
`Surface::Vulkan` refuses CPU conversion. On macOS `Surface::into_pixel_buffer()`
is the mirror: free for a hardware-decoded frame, an upload for a CPU one.
`Surface::into_i420()` returns typed pixels with size and color intact;
`I420::into_data()` explicitly extracts the packed bytes. `Surface::to_rgba(config)`
and `Surface::to_bgra(config)` are the portable exits for CPU
image and UI toolkits, returning owned, tightly packed pixels with the surface's
color metadata applied. Both orders are there because toolkits disagree and the
conversion is a full pass over the frame: producing the order the caller wants
costs nothing extra, while producing the other one and swapping two channels
afterwards costs a second pass. They borrow the surface, so a frame held behind
an `Arc` shared with something else converts without being unwrapped first.
Backends are tried hardware-first, like encode:

| Codec | Software | macOS | Windows | Linux | Android |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H.264 | OpenH264 (feature `openh264`, default) | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation (DXVA) | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`), VAAPI (feature `vaapi`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| H.265 | none | VideoToolbox | Media Foundation (DXVA) | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, API 26+) |
| AV1 | none | none | none | NVDEC (feature `nvidia`) | MediaCodec (feature `mediacodec`, when the device provides it) |
| VP8, VP9 | libvpx (feature `vpx`) | none | none | none | none |

On macOS and iOS VideoToolbox decodes H.264 and H.265 on hardware, pulling the parameter
sets (SPS/PPS, plus VPS for H.265) out of each keyframe to build the format
description. On Windows the Microsoft decoder MFT runs synchronously with a
Direct3D11 device bound to it, so the decode happens on the GPU through DXVA
(NVDEC / Intel / AMD). H.264 falls back to openh264 on a GPU-less host; H.265 has
no software decoder, so it needs the GPU path (on Windows, an HEVC decoder MFT:
the inbox HEVC Video Extensions or a vendor one). On Linux, NVDEC decodes H.264,
H.265, and 8-bit 4:2:0 AV1 to CUDA NV12 frames; AV1 is decode-only and is useful
for AV1 source to H.264/H.265 transcode rungs. VAAPI decodes H.264 to DMA-BUF
surfaces the renderer imports without a download. libvpx decodes VP8 and VP9
profile 0 to CPU I420 on every platform; other VP9 profiles (4:4:4, 10-bit) are
refused rather than narrowed to 8-bit 4:2:0. Any other rendition yields
`Error::UnsupportedCodec`.

`decode::Config::output` says where decoded pictures live: `Output::Native`
(the default) hands back whatever the backend decoded into, a GPU surface or
CPU pixels, and `Output::Cpu` delivers every picture as `Surface::I420`,
decoded straight to system memory where the backend can and downloaded where it
cannot. `decode::Config::scale_hint` asks a decoder with a hardware scaler
(NVDEC) to emit that size; it is a hint, so check `Frame::size` and use
`Frame::resize` for the exact size. `decode::Consumer` takes `decode::Options`,
which pairs that config with the subscription's `start` and `max_delay`.
