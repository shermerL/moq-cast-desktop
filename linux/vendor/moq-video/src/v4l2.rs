//! Shared V4L2 memory-to-memory device plumbing for the Linux hardware codec
//! backends.
//!
//! M2M is the kernel interface an ARM SoC exposes its video codec through: one
//! device node with two queues, OUTPUT for what userspace feeds in and CAPTURE
//! for what the hardware hands back. An encoder takes raw frames on OUTPUT and
//! returns an elementary stream on CAPTURE; a decoder runs the same node the
//! other way around. Both backends drive it through the [`Device`] and [`Queue`]
//! here, so the ioctl sequence, the buffer pool, and the plane arithmetic are
//! written once.
//!
//! Built on the raw layer of the `v4l` crate that the camera capture path
//! already uses: `v4l::v4l_sys` supplies the `videodev2.h` structs and
//! `v4l::v4l2::vidioc` the request codes, so nothing here hand-rolls a struct
//! offset.
//!
//! The driver, not the caller, decides the raw layout. `VIDIOC_S_FMT` is a
//! negotiation, and the [`Format`] that comes back can carry a different fourcc,
//! a wider stride, and more rows than were asked for. [`Planes`] reads that
//! answer and is the only thing either backend consults about where chroma
//! lives.
