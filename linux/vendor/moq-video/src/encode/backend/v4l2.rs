//! Hardware H.264 backend via the V4L2 stateful M2M encoder (Linux).
//!
//! The encoder most ARM SoCs ship: a Raspberry Pi's VideoCore (`bcm2835-codec`),
//! and the equivalent block on Rockchip, Amlogic, Allwinner, and Samsung parts.
//! Without it a Pi either republishes what `rpicam-vid` already encoded or
//! spends its CPU on openh264.
//!
//! Behind the opt-in `v4l2` feature. It costs no runtime dependency (the
//! interface is ioctls on a device node), only the `v4l` crate's build-time
//! bindgen, and a host with no M2M node fails at open so automatic selection
//! falls through to the next encoder.
//!
//! Feeds the driver 8-bit 4:2:0 and takes back Annex-B with in-band SPS/PPS
//! ahead of every IDR, which is the avc3 shape the H.264 importer expects.
//! [`Planes`](crate::v4l2::Planes) owns the layout: the driver picks the raw
//! fourcc, the stride, and the padded row count, and none of the three has to be
//! what was asked for.
//!
//! Two things the driver will not do by itself, both learned on a Pi:
//!   1. `bcm2835-codec` defaults to H.264 level 1.0, which is 176x144. The level
//!      has to be set from the resolution, framerate, and bitrate before
//!      `VIDIOC_S_FMT` or the encoder refuses anything larger, and no ioctl
//!      reports the default, so there is nothing to detect and the level is
//!      always set.
//!   2. Repeated parameter sets have two controls and drivers implement one
//!      each: `bcm2835-codec` has `REPEAT_SEQ_HEADER` and not
//!      `PREPEND_SPSPPS_TO_IDR`. Both are asked for and whichever lands wins,
//!      because a subscriber joining at a later keyframe can only start if that
//!      keyframe carries SPS/PPS.
//!
//! Run on a Raspberry Pi 4 (`bcm2835-codec`, `/dev/video11`): 640x360 at 30fps
//! comes out as Constrained Baseline with SPS and PPS ahead of every keyframe,
//! and plays back with a correct picture. The ioctl sequence is carried over
//! from an implementation that also ran on a Pi Zero 2 W and a Pi 3; those two
//! have not been re-run with this port.
