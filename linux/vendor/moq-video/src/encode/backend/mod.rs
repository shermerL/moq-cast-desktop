//! Pluggable video encoder backends.
//!
//! [`Backend`] is the seam between frame input prep (capture + color conversion,
//! owned by [`Encoder`](super::Encoder)) and the codec itself. Every backend
//! takes a raw [`Frame`] and emits Annex-B with in-band parameter sets (SPS/PPS,
//! plus VPS for H.265), the framing the matching catalog importer expects. Each
//! backend produces exactly one codec, so the producer can route its packets to
//! the right importer.
//!
//! Output is stamped with the timestamp of the frame it was encoded from, not
//! whichever frame happened to be going in. A backend that flushes each frame
//! before returning just echoes the input timestamp; one that buffers (Media
//! Foundation, MediaCodec) correlates through the codec's own sample clock.
//!
//! [`open`] picks the best backend for a [`Codec`](super::Codec) +
//! [`Kind`](super::Kind): only candidates that support the requested codec are
//! considered, hardware (platform-gated) before the OpenH264 software fallback
//! when this build enables it.
