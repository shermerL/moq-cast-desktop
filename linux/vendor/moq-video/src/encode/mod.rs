//! Encode captured video and publish it as a moq video track.
//!
//! The output codec is selected via [`Codec`] (H.264 or H.265); see its docs
//! for which backends cover each on this platform.
//!
//! Entry points, high to low level:
//! - `publish_capture` captures and publishes a webcam (turnkey). Requires the
//!   `capture` feature. `Control::new` is the same with a handle kept for
//!   controlling it while it runs (asking for a keyframe), plus the `Driver`
//!   that runs it.
//! - [`Encoder`] encodes raw [`Frame`](crate::Frame)s you supply into
//!   [`Encoded`] access units, and [`Producer`] publishes those (bring your own
//!   frames). Build both for the same [`Codec`].
//! - [`Sink`] is an [`Encoder`] that owns the thread it runs on, for an encoder
//!   outliving a single thread's stack (a shared object, an FFI handle, a task
//!   that migrates between workers).
//! - [`Producer`] alone publishes frames you already encoded.
//!
//! A [`Producer`] advertises its catalog rendition as soon as the track exists,
//! resolved from the encoder itself via [`Config::probe`], so a subscriber can
//! discover a track nothing has encoded yet. That's what makes on-demand
//! encoding possible at all.
//!
//! `Capture` / `Options` (with `capture`) / [`Kind`] / [`Config`] configure them.
//! [`Config::preset`] picks a [`Preset`], how the encoder trades latency for
//! compression at the configured bitrate, and [`Encoder::applied`] reports the
//! controls the backend actually applied for it. The decode/consume
//! counterpart (mirror of `moq-audio`'s consumer) lives in the sibling
//! [`decode`](crate::decode) module.
//!
//! The shared [`moq_mux::rate`] policy maps a congestion-control bandwidth
//! estimate onto the encoder's bitrate, which `publish_capture` drives for you.
