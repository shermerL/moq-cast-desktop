//! Hardware H.264 decode via the V4L2 stateful M2M decoder (Linux).
//!
//! The mirror of the encode backend, on the same device abstraction and usually
//! on a sibling node of the same driver: a Raspberry Pi decodes on
//! `/dev/video10` and encodes on `/dev/video11`, both `bcm2835-codec`. Behind
//! the same opt-in `v4l2` feature.
//!
//! Access units go in on the OUTPUT queue in decode order and pictures come back
//! on CAPTURE as CPU [`Surface::I420`](crate::Surface). The driver copies each
//! input buffer's timestamp onto the picture it produced, so presentation times
//! survive decoder delay without any bookkeeping here.
//!
//! Stateful is the operative word. The driver parses the stream itself and
//! announces the picture size with a `V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`, which is why
//! the CAPTURE queue does not exist until the first parameter sets have been
//! fed: [`Backend::decode`] returns no frames until it arrives, which is the
//! buffering the trait already allows for. The same event later means the stream
//! changed size, and the CAPTURE queue is torn down and renegotiated.
//!
//! Only H.264, and only stateful. A Raspberry Pi 4's separate HEVC block and
//! Rockchip's `rkvdec` are *stateless* V4L2 decoders: they take per-slice
//! parameters through the media request API and expect userspace to have parsed
//! the bitstream, which is a different interface rather than another format
//! here. [`Config::scale_hint`] is ignored, since these drivers scale on a separate
//! ISP node rather than on the decoder.
//!
//! Run on a Raspberry Pi 4 (`bcm2835-codec`, `/dev/video10`): a 720p H.264
//! stream decodes and plays at a steady 30fps. The decoder holds several
//! hundred milliseconds of pictures in its own queue, measured at about 690ms
//! end to end against a software decoder on the same Pi, so a caller that
//! cares about delay more than CPU may prefer openh264 there. The ioctl
//! sequence follows the kernel's stateful decoder documentation and an
//! implementation that also ran on a Pi Zero 2 W and a Pi 3.
