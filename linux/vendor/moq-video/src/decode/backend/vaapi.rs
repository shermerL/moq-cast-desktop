//! Intel/AMD VAAPI hardware H.264 decode via the opt-in `moq-vaapi` crate on Linux.
//!
//! The decode half of [`encode::backend::vaapi`](crate::encode). `moq-vaapi` is a
//! focused VA-API H.264 codec vendored and trimmed from cros-libva +
//! discord/cros-codecs. Its decoder takes one Annex-B access unit with the
//! parameter sets inline and hands back tightly-packed NV12, which this
//! deinterleaves to the CPU I420 the rest of the crate speaks.
//!
//! libva is `dlopen`'d at runtime, so a VAAPI-enabled build needs no libva at
//! build time and the binary carries no `NEEDED libva`. A libva-less host, a
//! missing render node, or a driver with no H.264 decode entrypoint makes
//! `Decoder::new` return an error; under automatic selection
//! [`backend::open`](super::open) then moves on to the next candidate, like the
//! NVDEC backend.
//!
//! Progressive 8-bit 4:2:0 only, which is everything a browser's `VideoEncoder`,
//! WebRTC, or this crate's own encoders emit. The decoder rejects an interlaced or
//! high-bit-depth sequence at its first SPS, which surfaces here as a decode
//! error rather than wrong pixels. Left and top cropping are also rejected.
//!
//! Unlike NVDEC, which cuvid lets us pin to zero display delay, output trails the
//! input even without B-frames: H.264's DPB releases a picture only once a later
//! one needs its slot, and the slot count comes from the sequence's reference and
//! reorder limits rather than the reorder depth actually used. A stream coded with
//! three reference frames therefore keeps three pictures in hand, which is why
//! this backend implements [`Backend::flush`] and the layers above call it when
//! the track ends. The decoded frames carry their own timestamps, so the delay
//! itself needs nothing downstream.
//!
//! Under [`Output::Native`](crate::Output::Native) each picture comes back as
//! the zero-copy [`Surface::DmaBuf`] the hardware decoded it into. Measured on
//! Intel Meteor Lake with iHD, a decode target exports at modifier
//! `0x100000000000009`, and the renderer imports that a memory plane at a time,
//! so the pixels reach a texture untouched
//! (`decoded_frames_reach_the_gpu_without_a_download` in the render module
//! draws them). A driver that decodes but cannot export falls back to
//! downloading, which native output permits.
//!
//! [`Output::Cpu`](crate::Output::Cpu) downloads inside the backend rather than
//! leaving it to the generic conversion, because exporting is not free:
//! handing a surface out retires it from the decoder's recycling pool, since a
//! later picture decoded over it would corrupt one the consumer still holds, so
//! it costs an allocation per picture on top of the download the CPU consumer
//! pays anyway. A native consumer that still wants pixels is not stranded:
//! [`Surface::into_i420`](crate::Surface::into_i420) answers, because
//! `moq-vaapi` keeps the retired surface alongside the descriptor and reads it
//! back through `vaDeriveImage` rather than trying to read a tiled buffer as
//! rows.
