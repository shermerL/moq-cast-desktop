#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "openh264"), allow(dead_code))]

//! H.264 conformance decode: bitstreams nothing in this crate produced.
//!
//! Every other decode test here encodes its own input first, so an encoder and a
//! decoder that share a misunderstanding agree with each other and pass. These
//! feed committed libx264 streams to whichever backends open on the host and
//! check the pictures against a reference decode, which no backend in this crate
//! had a hand in.
//!
//! The fixtures in `test_data/` are progressive 8-bit 4:2:0, IPPP (no B-frames,
//! so decode order is presentation order) at 30fps, and were produced with
//! ffmpeg's libx264:
//!
//! ```text
//! gen() { ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "$1" -frames:v "$2" -c:v libx264 \
//!     -profile:v "$3" -bf 0 -g "$4" -pix_fmt yuv420p -f h264 "$5"; }
//! gen "color=c=blue:s=64x64:r=30"   2 baseline 1 idr_64x64_blue_2f.h264
//! gen "testsrc2=s=64x64:r=30"       5 baseline 4 seq_64x64_pattern_5f.h264
//! gen "color=c=yellow:s=64x64:r=30" 5 main     4 main_64x64_yellow_5f.h264
//! gen "testsrc2=s=100x66:r=30"      5 baseline 4 seq_100x66_pattern_5f.h264
//!
//! for f in seq_64x64_pattern_5f seq_100x66_pattern_5f; do
//!     ffmpeg -i $f.h264 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p $f.yuv
//! done
//! ```
//!
//! | Fixture | Profile | Pictures | Size | What it is for |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `idr_64x64_blue_2f.h264` | Constrained Baseline | 2, both IDR | 64x64 | Intra only, and a saturated color a channel swap or bias cannot survive |
//! | `seq_64x64_pattern_5f.h264` | Constrained Baseline | 5 (I P P P I) | 64x64 | Inter prediction: the picture has to be updated, not repeated |
//! | `main_64x64_yellow_5f.h264` | Main | 5 (I P P P I) | 64x64 | CABAC rather than CAVLC entropy coding |
//! | `seq_100x66_pattern_5f.h264` | Constrained Baseline | 5 (I P P P I) | 100x66 | Non-square and not macroblock-aligned, so the SPS crops 112x80 down and a decoder that ignores that returns the wrong picture |
//!
//! Every fixture ends on an IDR, which is what keeps the picture counts
//! assertable. [`Backend`] has no drain, and a decoder that bumps its DPB only
//! when the buffer fills rather than at the reorder depth the VUI declares (the
//! VA-API backend does this, and holds `num_ref_frames` pictures for it) would
//! otherwise still be sitting on most of a short stream when it ended. A closing
//! IDR flushes everything before it, so at most the final picture is ever
//! outstanding.
//!
//! Committed rather than generated at test time on purpose. The whole set is
//! under 90 KB, `rs/moq-mux` already carries fMP4 fixtures the same way, and a
//! suite that shells out to ffmpeg either fails or silently skips wherever
//! ffmpeg is absent, which is the failure mode this is meant to close.
//!
//! The two solid-color fixtures need no reference file: every sample of every
//! plane is one known value, asserted exactly. The two pattern fixtures carry
//! the reference decode as raw I420 next to the bitstream. Both comparisons are
//! exact, because 8-bit H.264 decoding is normatively bit-exact: two conforming
//! decoders given the same stream produce the same samples, so a difference is a
//! defect rather than a tolerance to widen.
