//! Zero-copy import of Linux DMA-BUFs into wgpu's Vulkan backend.
//!
//! wgpu owns the Vulkan images and imported descriptors once wrapping succeeds.
//! The [`DmaBuf`] itself rides with the submitted render work separately, keeping
//! the dequeued producer buffer out of PipeWire's pool until the GPU is done.
//!
//! wgpu-hal's importer describes one image made of one memory plane, which for a
//! packed format is the whole buffer and for a planar one is not. Mesa reports
//! two memory planes for `VK_FORMAT_G8_B8R8_2PLANE_420_UNORM` under every
//! modifier it lists, so NV12 has no route through that importer as a single
//! image. Taken a plane at a time it does: the same driver reports one memory
//! plane for `R8_UNORM` and `R8G8_UNORM`, so a luma import and a chroma import of
//! the same object, each at its own offset and row pitch, alias the buffer as the
//! two textures the NV12 shader wants. Nothing is copied and nothing is
//! reformatted; only the descriptor is duplicated, once per plane.
//!
//! What that leaves is the modifier itself. A buffer whose modifier the driver
//! lists for neither format has nowhere to go at all, and the import fails so
//! the renderer downloads the frame instead. Nothing here re-tiles such a
//! buffer into a layout Vulkan would take: on the hardware this was measured on,
//! a VA-API decode target already lands on an importable modifier.
