//! Bridges a blocking, pull-style capture device (V4L2 on Linux, Media
//! Foundation on Windows) to the async [`FrameChannel`].
//!
//! Those device reads are blocking syscalls with no async form, so they run on a
//! dedicated thread that pushes frames into the channel; the encode loop awaits
//! them like any other backend. The device is built on the thread (so a `!Send`
//! handle such as `IMFSourceReader` is fine) and dropped when the thread exits.
//! [`PumpGuard`] stops and joins the thread when the [`Stream`](super::Stream)
//! drops, releasing the device. The stop flag is checked between reads, so on a
//! live device (which delivers a frame per interval) shutdown is prompt; a read
//! with no frame to hand back returns [`Read::Idle`] rather than blocking, which
//! is what keeps a held capture (a minimized window) just as prompt. The join
//! is what guarantees the device fd is closed before a subsequent reopen, so we
//! don't race EBUSY. A wedged device that blocks a read forever would stall that
//! join, the same as the original `spawn_blocking` path did, but that needs a
//! driver that delivers neither a frame nor an error.
